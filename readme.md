To test a change, add the `assets` folder with the `pack.png` and `pack.mcmeta` files into an archive. Data folder is for the datapack, assets folder is for the resource pack. You can add the datapack archive to a world file in Minecraft, and the Resource Pack can be applied like any other resource pack. Please ensure that you have checked **any and all changes** prior to making a commit or merge.
