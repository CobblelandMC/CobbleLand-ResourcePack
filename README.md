# Cobbleland Resource Pack

The Datapack and Resource Pack are split into separate branches, both [main-resourcepack] and [main-datapack]. Union's datapack and resource pack are named separately to avoid confusion.

## Resource Pack
The resource pack is for Pokemon assets, namely textures, animations, models, and a few other kinds of files like item textures, NBT assignments, species files, etc.
### Please ensure that any data (i.e. spawn files, stats, species features etc.) are in the datapack branch, and not the Resource Pack branch.

# Before making any commits, please test them locally.
To test a change, add the `assets` folder with the `pack.png` and `pack.mcmeta` files into an archive. Data folder is for the datapack, assets folder is for the resource pack. You can add the datapack archive to a world file in Minecraft, and the Resource Pack can be applied like any other resource pack. Please ensure that you have checked **any and all changes** prior to making a commit.

### If you are unsure about your commits, please receive confirmation from somebody who has prior knowledge and experience with updates. This can be done with using the "pull requests" function. It does not hurt to ask questions.
