For some reason, certain regional forms like to crash in /redeem fragment <species> (such as Hisuian Zoroark) even though the resolver does not affect their skins. As such, this folder exists to catch all possible skins that these regional variants can technically have due to being the same species, but as a result of equipping said aspect/skin to this regional variant, ends up causing a crash. With these resolvers, we redirect the would-be crashing skins back to their base models.
